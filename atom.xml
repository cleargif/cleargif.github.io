    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A little while ago a intern asked me for advise. The question was just for some general advise about
being a better Front-End Developer. Here is was I wrote back.</p>

<p>The best advise I can give you is to never think you have reached an expert level at anything.</p>

<p>Web development changes faster than you think. In a year from now 50% of what you know / do today
will be old news. Keep learning, keep watching videos, talks, presentations and follow the big
names in the industry.</p>

<h3 id="open-a-twitter-account">Open a twitter account.</h3>
<p>Use it only for keeping an eye on things that are happening - and the people who make them happen.</p>

<p>Use Chrome! Get onto a Mac. Learn to love command line. Lint your JavaScript.</p>

<p>People you need to follow / research:</p>

<h3 id="js">JS:</h3>

  <li>Addy Osmani</li>
  <li>Sindre Sorhus</li>
  <li>Ben Alman</li>
  <li>Rebecca Murphey</li>
  <li>Douglas Crockford - you can never read / watch enough of this guy!</li>
  <li>Derek Bailey (watchmecode.com)</li>
  <li>Remy Sharp</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="html">HTML:</h3>
<ul>

  <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">Mozilla Developer Network</a></li>

<p>NEVER NEVER NEVER: www.w3schools.com EVER!!</p>

<h3 id="websites">Websites:</h3>

  <li><a href="http://www.appliness.com/">appliness</a> (they have an iPad app)</li>
</ul>

<p>FE development these days is about JavaScript and the workflow around it. But just jumping into
JS using a library is dangerous.</p>

<p>LEARN JS. Understand JS. Then get into libraries - and before using a library - look at the source
of it. You learn SO MANY things doing that.</p>

<h3 id="get-a-github-account">Get a github account.</h3>
<p>Build prototypes of things. Find bad code online and refactor that. Commit both to github.
This can be an awesome portfolio for when you go for interviews. I have lost out on work for not
having this - and later I have gotten work as a result of having this. I have even sent the refactored
code to the company where I found it. Dodgy territory - but handle it well and you might just land a job.</p>

<p>Search for interview questions on the internet - technical questions. Github has many. Do them, research
the things you do not know. Do not stop until you get it.</p>

<h3 id="getting-a-job">Getting a job:</h3>
<p>Go into a medium sized marketing agency. The hours are crap. But because of the pace you gain
experience very fast. 1 year in that environment is like 3 years in another industry.</p>

<p>Now, start here and good luck.
<a href="http://rmurphey.com/blog/2012/04/12/a-baseline-for-front-end-developers/">Base line for FE Developers</a></p>

<h3 id="lastly">Lastly:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>NEVER go to an interview without your laptop.</li>
  <li>Your CV means nothing.</li>
  <li>Your code is your CV. (github)</li>
  <li>Your degree / diploma will only help you so far. There are 12 year old kids doing presentations
at conferences. Think twice before you bank on your education. Harsh - I know. But true. You will see.</li>
</ul>

<p>Been meaning to get a blog going for a while now. Even tried Octopress a while
back but it did not go so well. Lucky for me I tried it again and it could not
have been easier.</p>

<p>Will post any changes I am making to the config here.</p>

<p><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/" target="_blank">Start here</a> and you will be up and running
in no time at all.</p>

<p>Going to try and post a few things each week. Let see how it goes.</p>
